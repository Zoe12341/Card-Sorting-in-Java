* For this assignment, me and Deepa Mahesh pair programmed. 

Writing the code for all the different sort methods allowed me to better understand how they work, and the benefits of each one. I found the insertion sort most intuative to work on, and the quick sort the most interesting one to visualize. Using recursion still takes a bit more thinking for me to fully wrap my head around. This assignment felt easier than the last one, and I was able to move through the stages faster. 

Collaborating with Deepa Mahesh was a helpful experience. Having someone to bounce ideas off as soon as they popped into my head was extremely helpful. Splitting up the work with someone was one of the reasons I was able to move through the assignment so fast. Deepa was a great partner too! She was flexible and willing to do help with anything I was struggling with.
